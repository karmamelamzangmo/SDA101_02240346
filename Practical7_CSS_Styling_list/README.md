# College Events Webpage

## Project Overview
This project is a simple HTML webpage that lists different types of college events, including Cultural, Sports, Literary Activities, and Religious Events. Each event category provides specific event details, including the event name, venue, and time.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: The structure and content of the webpage are created using HTML5 elements.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the webpage with an ordered list and nested unordered lists for event details.
- `events.css`: A CSS file (assumed to be linked, but not provided here) intended for styling the webpage.

## Sections
1. **Title**: "College Events" as the main header.
2. **Event Categories**: An ordered list with categories like Cultural Events, Sports, Literary Activities, and Religious Events. Each category has a nested list with specific event information.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the webpage.

## Future Improvements
- Add CSS styling for better visual presentation.
- Use JavaScript for dynamic content updates or interactivity, such as filtering events by type.
- Enhance the layout to include images or links to additional event information.
