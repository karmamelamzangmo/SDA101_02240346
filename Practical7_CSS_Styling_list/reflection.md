# Reflection

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
The main concepts applied in this project include:
1. **Ordered and Unordered Lists**: I used an ordered list (`<ol>`) to organize the main categories of events and unordered lists (`<ul>`) to list details for each event within those categories.
2. **Basic HTML Structure**: The page follows a basic structure with a header, main content, and linked CSS for potential styling (though no CSS file was provided here). This structure ensures content is presented in a clean and organized way.

### New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
This project helped me reinforce my understanding of:
- **Nested Lists in HTML**: I practiced creating a nested list structure where an ordered list is used for main event categories, and unordered lists for details about each event.
- **Page Organization and Readability**: I learned the importance of using clear, meaningful class names (e.g., `class="head"`) for better readability and future styling, and organizing content in logical sections.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
This project taught me the value of organizing content in a hierarchical manner using ordered and unordered lists. It was a good exercise in presenting data in a structured, readable way that also allows for easy styling and future expansion.

### Challenges Faced
One challenge I encountered was how to structure the event details under each category. Initially, I placed the event details directly as list items within the main `<ol>`. However, this made it difficult to distinguish between category names and event details, as shown below:

To overcome this, I moved each set of event details into separate `<ul>` tags nested within the main `<ol>`, which allowed the categories to remain as primary items while keeping each eventâ€™s details visually grouped.

This adjustment helped organize the page better and made it clearer where each event category started and ended. Additionally, this structure will allow for easier CSS styling if I want to add custom styles in the future.

Overall, this project helped improve my understanding of HTML list structures and webpage organization, skills I can use in more complex projects.
