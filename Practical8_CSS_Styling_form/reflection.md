## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
The main concepts applied in this project include:
1. **HTML Form Structure**: Creating an HTML form that includes various input types, such as text fields, dropdowns, and a date picker. This structure is crucial for collecting specific user data related to maintenance requests.
2. **Input Validation**: Using the `required` attribute on fields such as the date, name, and urgency to ensure essential information is provided before submission.
3. **Semantic Form Organization**: Labeling each input field with `<label>` elements to improve form accessibility and readability.

### New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
This project helped me improve my understanding of:
- **Form Inputs and User Experience**: I learned how to arrange different input types to capture specific details in a user-friendly way.
- **Dropdown Menus for Selection**: Using `<select>` elements with `<option>` tags for predefined choices (e.g., room numbers and urgency levels), which simplifies form completion for the user and improves accuracy.
- **Input Types for Various Needs**: I practiced using a variety of input types like `date` and `text`, which are essential for different kinds of data collection.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
This project taught me the value of organizing form fields logically, grouping related fields to make data entry easy for users. I also learned how important accessibility features like `<label>` tags are for improving the usability of a form, especially for screen reader users.

### Challenges Faced
One challenge I encountered was how to manage the **Room Number** and **Urgency** fields. Initially, I had considered using text inputs for these, but this allowed too much variation and required extra validation. 

To overcome this, I replaced these text inputs with `<select>` elements, allowing users to choose from predefined options. This streamlined the form and reduced the chances of invalid or ambiguous responses.
This change improved both the accuracy and usability of the form, as users can now select options instead of typing them manually.

Overall, I gained a lot from this exercise in terms of structuring forms, using different input types, and planning for user-friendly interactions. Moving forward, I hope to style the form with CSS and explore adding JavaScript for more dynamic form validations.
