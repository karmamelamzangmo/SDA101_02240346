# Hostel Room Maintenance Form

## Project Overview
This project is a simple HTML form created to facilitate hostel room maintenance requests. The form allows users to submit details about maintenance issues, including their name, room number, type of issue, urgency level, and a brief description of the issue.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Used to structure and organize the content of the maintenance form.
- CSS (linked as `Hostel_maintenance.css`): Assumed to be used for styling the form (not provided here).

## Form Fields
1. **Date**: The date on which the request is submitted.
2. **Name**: Full name of the requester.
3. **Room Number**: The room number where maintenance is required, selected from a dropdown.
4. **Type of Issue**: A text field to specify the type of issue.
5. **Description**: An open text field for a detailed description of the issue.
6. **Urgency**: A dropdown to indicate the urgency level of the request (Immediate, Medium, Low).

## Usage
Open `index.html` in any web browser to view and use the form. Once filled out, users can submit the form by pressing the "Submit" button.

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript for form validation and interactive feedback.
- Style the form with CSS to improve visual appearance and layout.
- Integrate with a backend to store form submissions in a database for processing.
