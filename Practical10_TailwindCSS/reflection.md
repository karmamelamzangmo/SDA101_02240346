# Reflection

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
This project applied several core concepts, including:
1. **Responsive Design with Tailwind**: I used Tailwind’s responsive classes (like `sm:` and `md:`) to ensure that the layout and typography adapt to different screen sizes.
2. **Micro-Interactions with Hover Effects**: Tailwind's hover effects (like `hover:bg-blue-600` and `hover:scale-105`) helped create interactive elements without the need for custom JavaScript.
3. **Container Utility for Centering**: Tailwind’s `container` and `mx-auto` classes centered the main elements, making the layout more balanced.

### New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
This project taught me:
- **Using Tailwind for Quick Styling**: Tailwind allows for rapid, flexible design. I enjoyed the simplicity of applying styles with utility classes instead of writing custom CSS.
- **Micro-Interactions**: I experimented with transition effects to make interactions feel smooth and natural, adding depth to the design.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how powerful Tailwind is for quickly prototyping responsive and visually appealing layouts. I found it much faster than traditional CSS, and I appreciated the ease of adding micro-interactions directly within HTML.

### Challenges Faced
One challenge I faced was with **image loading**. Originally, I intended to add an image to enhance the main section but encountered an issue.

To overcome this, I checked the file path and verified that the image was correctly placed in the `images` folder. After troubleshooting, I learned that it’s essential to verify image sources before embedding them.

Overall, this project taught me about efficient styling with Tailwind and emphasized the importance of verifying paths and assets before finalizing a design. I am excited to use Tailwind in future projects for its simplicity and flexibility.
