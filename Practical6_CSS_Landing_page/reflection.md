## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
The key concepts applied in this project include:
1. **HTML Structure**: Creating a well-organized HTML structure using semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. This structure ensures content is accessible and easily navigable.
2. **Basic E-commerce Layout**: Designing a layout that could be used for an e-commerce site, including sections like navigation, hero banner, product showcase, and footer.
3. **Product Grid**: Implementing a grid layout for the featured products section to present multiple products in a visually appealing and organized way, which is a common layout requirement for online stores.

### New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
Through this project, I acquired a better understanding of:
- **Semantic HTML**: I learned the importance of semantic tags for accessibility and SEO. By using elements like `<section>` and `<nav>`, the webpage becomes more readable and usable.
- **Webpage Layout Planning**: This project helped me grasp the fundamentals of planning a webpage layout that can be easily styled and expanded upon in the future. I learned to anticipate how the HTML structure could support CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.

### What I Learned
This project taught me how to build a basic, well-structured HTML template for an e-commerce site. By focusing on the main sections (header, main content, and footer), I learned how to create an intuitive, easy-to-navigate layout. I also realized the significance of using semantic tags and organizing content hierarchically, which will help when applying CSS for responsiveness and styling.

### Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I encountered was setting up the grid layout in the **Featured Products** section to ensure that products would align properly without CSS. This required using `<div>` containers strategically for each product and arranging them so they could later be styled effectively. 

To overcome this challenge, I researched basic grid layouts and structured the HTML with extra `<div>` elements for each product. This allowed me to visualize how the layout could later be styled with CSS, which is helpful in building modular, responsive layouts.

Another challenge was ensuring that the **Footer** section was functional and visually balanced. Placing social media icons alongside text links required organizing the footerâ€™s content carefully. I decided to use a list format within the `<footer>` tag to allow for simple styling in the future.

With these adjustments, I feel more confident about using HTML for structured layouts and anticipating how CSS and JavaScript could enhance functionality.
