# Reflection on Personal Profile



## Main Concepts Applied


*Visual Hierarchy & Layout Design*

•⁠  ⁠For both pages, I focused on creating a clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the content intuitively. In the Landing Page, the layout directs attention from the main headline to call-to-action (CTA) buttons and featured sections. For the About Me Page, I organized content to flow naturally through sections, allowing users to quickly understand my background and skills.

•⁠  ⁠Implemented a grid system to maintain alignment and consistency, which helped create a cohesive look across both pages.

*Responsive Design*

•⁠  ⁠Designed responsive layouts for both pages, ensuring they are visually appealing and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. I used Figma's resizing constraints and Auto Layout to adjust elements automatically for different screen sizes, making the design adaptable and user-friendly.

*Typography & Branding Consistency*

•⁠  ⁠Consistent typography and brand colors were applied across both pages. I selected a readable and modern font for body text, using different font weights to emphasize headings and important sections. This consistency across pages helps reinforce my personal brand while ensuring readability.



## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

*Adaptive Layout Techniques*

•⁠  ⁠Working with responsive layouts helped me gain a better understanding of Auto Layout and constraints in Figma. I learned to make design elements adapt to various screen sizes, which will be valuable for future web projects.

*Component Creation & Reusability*

•⁠  ⁠I created reusable components, such as navigation bars, buttons, and icons, to maintain consistency and reduce design time. This modular approach allowed me to quickly update and reuse elements across pages, especially helpful as I continue building out more sections.

*Prototyping for Interaction*

•⁠  ⁠Setting up interactive prototypes enhanced my knowledge of Figma’s prototyping tools. I experimented with linking pages, creating hover states, and adding smooth transitions, which helped me understand how to build a more engaging user experience.

*Iconography & Visual Storytelling*

•⁠  ⁠For the About Me Page, I experimented with icons to visually represent skills, hobbies, and key milestones. Learning to integrate simple iconography added visual interest to text-heavy sections and made the timeline more engaging.



## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

*Challenge:* Ensuring consistent alignment and positioning of elements across different screen sizes was initially challenging, as elements would often shift or scale improperly.

*Solution:* I utilized Figma’s Auto Layout and resizing constraints to keep elements in place. By setting up a grid system and carefully adjusting padding and margins, I achieved a balanced layout that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
Creating Attention-Grabbing CTAs without Disrupting Flow

*Challenge:* On the Landing Page, designing CTAs that attract attention without detracting from the overall visual flow required careful thought.

*Solution:* I experimented with bold colors and contrasting text, making the CTA buttons prominent yet cohesive. This allowed the CTAs to stand out while blending harmoniously into the design.
Balancing Informational Content with Visual Appeal

*Challenge:* On the About Me Page, conveying my background and skills without overwhelming the user was a challenge. I wanted the page to be informative yet visually engaging.

*Solution:* I broke down content into sections, using short descriptions, icons, and a visual timeline. This structure made the content easier to read and navigate, while visual elements like icons added interest without overcrowding the page.
Prototyping Complex Interactions

*Challenge:* Adding interactivity in the timeline and skills sections was new to me, and ensuring these elements responded as intended was initially tricky.

*Solution:* I utilized Figma's prototyping settings and tested multiple transitions to fine-tune the user experience. Experimenting with different transitions and hover states allowed me to create a smooth, responsive interaction.
