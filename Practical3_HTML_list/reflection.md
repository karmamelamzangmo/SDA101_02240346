# Reflection

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
In building the "Semester Overview" webpage, I applied several core HTML concepts, including:
- **HTML Lists**: Used unordered lists (`<ul>`) to list courses and weekly to-dos, and ordered lists (`<ol>`) for structured daily schedules and study goals.
- **Semantic HTML**: Applied semantic elements such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>` to enhance readability and structure.
- **CSS Styling**: Although not fully implemented, the `year.css` file is linked, which will allow for future styling to make the page visually engaging.

### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
This project introduced me to organizing information within a structured HTML document for a real-world purpose. I learned:
- How to apply semantic HTML to improve code readability.
- The basics of linking a CSS stylesheet, which will help me style similar documents in future projects.
- Practical use of `<ul>` and `<ol>` lists to structure lists hierarchically.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
Working on this project enhanced my understanding of:
- **HTML Structuring**: Building structured documents with various lists and headings.
- **Project Planning**: Breaking down information logically helped me better plan how to structure my HTML and CSS.

### Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I encountered was ensuring the lists were organized and easy to read while avoiding repetitive tags. Initially, I struggled with choosing between `<ul>` and `<ol>` for certain sections, which led to minor layout inconsistencies.


To solve this, I referred to HTML documentation and learned that using nested `<ol>` tags for goals within each course was a more appropriate choice. This adjustment allowed for clearer organization and improved readability.

By the end, I felt more confident in building structured HTML documents and managing multiple types of lists within the same document.
