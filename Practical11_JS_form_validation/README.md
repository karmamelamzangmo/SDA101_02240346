# Registration Form with Validation

## Project Overview
This project is a registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring client-side validation. The form collects a username, email, password, and password confirmation. JavaScript is used to validate input fields to ensure data accuracy before submission.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structures the form and its fields.
- **CSS**: Provides basic styling for the form.
- **JavaScript**: Validates the form fields to enhance user experience and reduce form submission errors.

## Key Features
1. **Form Fields**: Includes fields for Username, Email, Password, and Confirm Password.
2. **Client-Side Validation**: Ensures all fields are correctly filled out before allowing submission.
   - **Username Validation**: Checks for non-empty input.
   - **Email Validation**: Checks for valid email format.
   - **Password Validation**: Ensures passwords match and meet specified criteria.
3. **Error Messages**: Displays error messages under each field if validation fails.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
2. Try entering invalid data in the fields and observe the error messages.
3. The **Register** button is disabled until all fields are valid.

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time feedback as the user types.
- Enhance the styling of error messages and add animations for a smoother user experience.
- Integrate with a backend to store registration data.
