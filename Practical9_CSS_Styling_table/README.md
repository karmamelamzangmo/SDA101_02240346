# Semester Grade Record Table

## Project Overview
This project is a simple HTML webpage displaying a table of semester grades for different modules. The table includes columns for the module name, assignment, maximum marks, marks obtained, percentage, and grade. It provides a summary of student performance across various assignments.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the grade record.
- **CSS (table.css)**: Used for styling the table and surrounding elements (assumed to be linked).

## Table Structure
1. **Table Header**: Lists column names like Module, Assignment, Max Marks, Marks Obtained, Percentage, and Grade.
2. **Table Rows**: Each row represents a module and includes details on the specific assignment, maximum possible marks, marks obtained, calculated percentage, and final grade.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the table. This simple table layout can be used to display grading or performance data in a clear, structured manner.

## Future Improvements
- Add CSS styling to enhance the table's appearance and readability.
- Add JavaScript for interactive features like sorting by column or calculating average marks.
