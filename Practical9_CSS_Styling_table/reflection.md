# Reflection

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
The main concepts applied in this project include:
1. **HTML Table Structure**: Using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements to organize data into a grid layout. Each row represents a different module, and each column provides specific details about the module's performance.
2. **Semantic Table Headers**: I used `<th>` for column headers, which improves accessibility and helps users and screen readers understand the table's purpose.
3. **Data Organization**: The table presents data in a logical, easy-to-read format that supports comparison across modules.

### New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
This project helped me gain a better understanding of:
- **Table Design for Readability**: I practiced organizing data in a way that makes it easy to follow. Adding clear headers and aligning data made the table more readable.
- **Structuring Information**: By breaking down each module’s data into individual columns, I improved my skill in creating structured, systematic displays of information.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
This project reinforced my understanding of HTML tables and taught me how important layout and organization are for readability. Designing tables to display data clearly and logically helps users comprehend information more quickly.

### Challenges Faced
One challenge I faced was managing the percentage calculations.

Initially, I inputted each percentage manually, which was time-consuming and prone to error. To simplify this process, I considered using JavaScript to calculate percentages dynamically. 

Although I didn’t implement JavaScript in this version, I plan to add it in the future to automate percentage calculations, making the process more efficient and less error-prone.

Overall, this project helped me improve my HTML skills, specifically with table structures and organizing data for clarity. I also see potential for future improvements by adding interactivity with JavaScript and enhancing visual style with CSS.
