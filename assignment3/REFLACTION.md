## 4. Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Organizing complex content in a logical structure.
   **Solution**: Divided the page into clear sections (header, content, resume, pricing, blog, contact) and used appropriate HTML elements for each.

2. **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent styling across different sections.
   **Solution**: Created a separate CSS file (image.css) to maintain all styles in one place, allowing for easier management and consistency.

3. **Challenge**: Implementing responsive design.
   **Solution**: Used CSS classes and media queries (assumed in the image.css file) to adjust layout and styling for different screen sizes.
