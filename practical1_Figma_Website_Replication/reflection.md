# Reflection on Website Replication



## Main Concepts Applied


-*Design Replication*: The primary objective was to replicate an existing website design as closely as possible. This required attention to detail, precise alignment, and accurate typography to match the original design.

-*Layout and Spacing*: I applied principles of layout design, working with Figma’s grid and rulers to ensure consistent spacing and alignment. This included accurately positioning text, images, and other elements.

-*Typography and Color Matching*: I used Figma’s typography tools to replicate font styles, sizes, and colors as accurately as possible. Color matching was essential, so I used the color picker to extract colors from the original website.



## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

-*Working with Grids and Guides*: I learned how to use Figma’s grid and guide tools to create a well-organized layout. This allowed me to align elements accurately and maintain consistent spacing throughout the design.

-*Typography Replication*: I became more familiar with font styling and layout details, ensuring my design matched the original typography closely.

-*Layering and Grouping*: Organizing elements with layers and grouping helped me manage complex layouts efficiently, making it easier to adjust or rearrange elements as needed.



## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

-*Challenge*: Matching the spacing and alignment exactly as in the original website was challenging. Small differences in spacing were noticeable and affected the overall appearance.

*Solution*: I relied on Figma’s ruler and grid features to measure distances accurately. Using a grid overlay helped maintain consistent spacing, and double-checking alignment for each section improved precision.

-*Challenge*: Finding the exact fonts and colors used in the original design took time.

*Solution*: I used Figma’s color picker to sample colors directly from the original website and explored similar fonts if the exact match wasn’t available. This approach helped me achieve a close approximation to the original design.
