## Description
The timetable webpage displays a weekly schedule with columns for each weekday and rows for each time slot. This format helps students easily view their schedule for each day, including classes and break times.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML document containing the timetable structure.
- `timetable.css`: The CSS file to style the timetable (to be customized as needed).

## Table Structure
- **Header Row**: Days of the week are listed from Monday to Friday.
- **Rows for Each Time Slot**:
  - 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Classes for each day.
  - 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break, spanning all columns.
  - 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Classes for each day.
  
The structure organizes class information and break times, providing an easy reference for students.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the timetable.
2. Customize `timetable.css` for specific styling needs.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more time slots or days if needed.
- Include dynamic functionality (e.g., hover effects or tooltips with more details about each class).
- Use JavaScript to allow customization, like highlighting the current day or time.
- Improve styling to make the timetable more visually engaging and responsive.
