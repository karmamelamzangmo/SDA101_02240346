# Reflection

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
In creating the timetable webpage, I applied several important HTML and CSS concepts:
- **HTML Table Structure**: I used `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags to structure the timetable, organizing it by time slots and days of the week.
- **Row and Column Spanning**: I applied the `colspan` attribute to the Lunch Break row, allowing it to span across multiple columns, making the table visually cleaner.
- **Basic CSS Styling**: I linked a CSS file to style the table, ensuring that elements like headers, time slots, and rows are clear and visually distinct.

### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
This project introduced me to:
- **Creating Responsive Tables**: I explored ways to organize information into rows and columns in an easily readable format.
- **Using Attributes in Tables**: I gained experience using the `colspan` attribute to merge columns for a break row, which helped to enhance readability.
- **CSS Styling for Tables**: I learned how to add basic styling to make the table visually appealing, including applying padding, border, and alignment styles.

### What I Learned
This project helped me better understand:
- **HTML Table Structure and Styling**: I learned how to effectively use table elements to present a timetable and use styling to make the structure more readable.
- **Usability of Tables**: Structuring information into a table format can make detailed data like schedules clearer and easier to reference for users.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Centering Content in Table Cells**: Initially, I struggled with vertically aligning text in each cell, especially in the lunch break row where the text appeared uneven.
   - **Solution**: I added `vertical-align: middle;` in the CSS for table cells, which ensured that text was centered vertically in each cell.


2. **Making the Table Responsive**: Since tables can be difficult to view on smaller screens, I found it challenging to make the timetable layout flexible for different devices.
   - **Solution**: I researched responsive design for tables and added a CSS rule to use `overflow-x: auto;` on the table container, allowing horizontal scrolling on smaller screens, which improved usability.

By the end of the project, I felt more confident in working with HTML tables and using CSS to enhance table presentation and layout. I also gained a better understanding of making tables accessible and user-friendly.
